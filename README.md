The Play to Donate App -- Memory Game!

Welcome to the Memorize To Donate app for iOS!
This is an open source iOS app developed by Alicia from Watch To Donate. 

As an avid iOS user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.
I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. It is simply a memory game for you to play, no data collected.
If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Sincerely,
Alicia Li
